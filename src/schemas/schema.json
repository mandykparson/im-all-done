        "Text": "The Shinkansen bullet train travels along high-speed railways throughout Japan at speeds of 240–320 km/hr (150–200 mph), carrying millions of passengers every year. However, when it was first designed, the high speeds caused an atmospheric pressure wave to build up in front of the train. When it would travel through tunnels, the wave would cause a loud “tunnel boom” at the exit, disturbing nearby residents. The engineers had to find a way for the train to travel more quietly without sacrificing speed or using more energy.",
